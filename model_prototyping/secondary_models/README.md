We want to take our classified data, and convert that into a format usable by QGIS

In the case of irrigation cannals, this means we need to convert the classified data into some lines representing the highest points allong cannal banks.

We have this two-stage aproach, because most classifcation problems we have to do just need a shape file -- which we can derive dirrectly from our labels

I also have a hunch that this two stage aproach will work better than a standalone model for generating the lines we need
